# Pokemon Type Weakness Tracker

This web app was created to help a partner keep track of **Pokemon types** and their respective **strengths and weaknesses**. It simplifies the process of determining which attack types are most effective against specific Pokemon. For example, is Ice strong against Grass? (Yes!) The app provides an easy way to find out, ensuring better decision-making during gameplay.

## Features
- **Type-based search**: Quickly find and filter Pokemon by their name or type properties.
- **Detailed weaknesses**: Lists all attack types a selected Pokemon is weak to, aiding strategic planning in battles.
- **Responsive design**: Works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices for easy access anytime, anywhere.

This project uses **React** for the frontend and integrates an **open-source Pokemon API** to fetch real-time data and assets of various Pokemon.
