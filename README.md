## Background:
My partner was learning Pokemon and couldn't keep track of all the different types and their strengths / weaknesses. For example, is Ice strong against Grass (yes)?
This web app allows her to type in the Pokemon she's currently against, and it will list out all the attack types that Pokemon is weak to.

## Details
SWP React website using open source pokemon API to fetch assets & data of various pokemon. 
Basic find/search/filtering of pokemons based on name, or properties.
